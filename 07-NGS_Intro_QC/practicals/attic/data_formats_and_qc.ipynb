    "# NGS Data formats and QC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are several file formats for storing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. In this tutorial we will look at some of the most common formats for storing NGS reads and variant data. We will cover the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "__FASTQ__ - This format stores unaligned read sequences with base qualities  \n",
    "__SAM/BAM__ - This format stores unaligned or aligned reads (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "__CRAM__ - This format is similar to BAM but has better compression than BAM  \n",
    "__VCF/BCF__ - Flexible variant call format for storing SNPs, indels, structural variations (text and binary formats)   \n",
    "\n",
    "Further to understanding the different file formats, it is important to remember that all sequencing platforms have technical limitations that can introduce biases in your sequencing data. Because of this it is very important to check the quality of the data before starting any analysis, whether you are planning to use something you have sequenced yourself or publicly available data. In the second part of this tutorial we will describe how to perform a QC assessment for your NGS data.\n"

The first 32 ASCII codes are reserved for control characters which are not printable, and the 33rd is reserved for space. Neither of these can be used in the quality string, so we need to subtract 33 from whatever the value of the quality character is. For example, the ASCII code of “A” is 65, so the corresponding quality is:\n",

    "[SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) format was developed by the 1000 Genomes Project group in 2009 and is a unified format for storing read alignments to a reference genome. SAM format is a standard format for storing NGS sequencing reads, base qualities, associated meta-data and alignments of the data to a reference genome. If no reference genome is available, the data can also be stored unaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files consist of a header section (optional) and an alignment section. The alignment section contains one record (a single DNA fragment alignment) per line describing the alignment between fragment and reference. Each record has 11 fixed columns and optional key:type:value tuples. Open the SAM/BAM file specification document [https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) either in a web browser or you can find a copy in the QC directory as you may need to refer to it throughout this tutorial. \n",

    "Each line in the SAM header begins with an `@`, followed by a two-letter header record type code as defined in the [SAM/BAM format specification document](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf). Each record type can contain meta-data captured as a series of key-value pairs in the format of ‘TAG:VALUE’.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read groups\n",
    "One useful record type is RG which can be used to describe each lane of sequencing. The RG code can be used to capture extra meta-data for the sequencing lane. Some common RG TAGs are:\n",

If a read cannot be represented as a linear alignment, but instead is represented as a group of linear alignments without large overlaps, it is called a __chimeric alignment__. These can for instance be caused by structural variations. Usually, one of the linear alignments in a chimeric alignment is considered to be the __representative__ alignment, and the others are called __supplementary__.\n",

    "BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) format, is a compressed binary version of SAM. This means that, while SAM is human readable, BAM is only readable for computers. BAM was developed for fast processing and random access. To achieve this, BGZF (Block GZIP) compression is used for indexing. BAM files can be viewed using samtools, and will then have the same format as a SAM file.  The key features of BAM are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can store alignments from most mappers\n",
    "* Supports multiple sequencing technologies\n",
    "* Supports indexing for quick retrieval/viewing\n",
    "* Compact size (e.g. 112Gbp Illumina = 116GB disk space)\n",
    "* Reads can be grouped into logical groups e.g. lanes, libraries, samples\n",
    "* Widely supported by variant calling packages and viewers\n",

For each sequencing cycle, there is a possibility that the replication machinery slips and either incorporates more than one nucleotide or perhaps misses to incorporate one at all. The more cycles that are run (i.e. the longer the read length gets), the greater the accumulation of these types of errors gets. This leads to a heterogeneous population in the cluster, and a decreased signal purity, which in turn reduces the precision of the base calling. The figure below shows an example of this."
